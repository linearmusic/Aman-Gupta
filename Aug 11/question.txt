Find all the phases for the following event station location -
Station - 22 91, 22 91
Event - 45 178, -18 -118
event depth - 30, 200

Plot the phases P,S,pP,Scs

For the first pair find the piercing point at 600km depth for PKiKP

For the second event station find the ray path of all the phases reflected or refracted from inner core
